/*************************************************************************************
Dependency Inversion Principle
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high level modules should not depend on low level modules;
 both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details.
 Details should depend upon abstractions. Itâ€™s extremely common when writing software to implement it such that
 each module or method specifically refers to its collaborators, which does the same.
 This type of programming typically lacks sufficient layers of abstraction, and results in a very tightly coupled system,
 since every module is directly referencing lower level modules.
